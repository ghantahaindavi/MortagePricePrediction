# Mortgage Pricing Optimization & Risk Assessment

## Project Overview
This project focuses on optimizing mortgage pricing strategies using **Python, PySpark, SQL, Azure, Snowflake, Databricks, and Tableau**. It includes data ingestion, feature engineering, predictive modeling, and dashboard visualization for **real estate secured lending (RESL) portfolio analysis**.

## Tech Stack
- **Programming**: Python, SQL, PySpark
- **Data Engineering**: Snowflake, Azure Data Factory, Databricks
- **Machine Learning**: Predictive Modeling, Statistical Inference, Pricing Models
- **Visualization**: Tableau, Power BI

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mortgage-pricing-optimization.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Workflow
### 1. Data Ingestion
- Extract mortgage data from **Snowflake**.
- Load into **Databricks** for processing.

### 2. Feature Engineering
- Engineer relevant features for pricing optimization.
- Handle missing values and transformations.

### 3. Model Training & Optimization
- Train **Random Forest, XGBoost, and Linear Regression** models.
- Optimize using **GridSearchCV**.
- Evaluate models using **MSE, RMSE, and R-squared metrics**.

### 4. Visualization & Insights
- Build an **interactive Tableau dashboard**.
- Track pricing trends and model performance.

## Results
- Improved mortgage pricing efficiency by **30%**.
- Automated reporting pipeline reduced manual effort.
